# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This Sorting Visualizer is a simple Python application that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. The application is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, ttk for styling, and numpy for generating random data.

# Features 
1. Visualize sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
2. Adjustable array size and speed for better visualization.
3. User-friendly interface.

# Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort: Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. Merge Sort: Divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

3. Quick Sort: Divide and conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

4. Insertion Sort: Simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms.

5. Selection Sort: Simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.
